                From as early as the 1970s, the Government has introduced measures to promote a smoke-free lifestyle in Singapore.
                In the early days of Singapore's independence, smoking was allowed indoors but it was not long before the Smoking Act was introduced in October 1970 to prohibit smoking in omnibuses, cinemas and theatres.
                The country's smoking rate has shrunk from 18.3% in 1992 to 10.6% in 2019, through a combination of legislative and public education efforts.
                Authorities have regulated tobacco advertising and conducted multiple anti-smoking campaigns, mindful of its allure with the young.
                They have also raised the minimum legal age, made tobacco products more expensive with higher taxes, and prohibited smoking in even more places.
                Still, the Government wants to reduce the smoking rate even further, to below 10% of the population by this year.
                To further bring down the rate, a range of options are being considered by the Government.
                For instance, the Government could consider offering better protection from secondhand smoke, further increasing the tobacco tax and regulating tobacco flavours.
