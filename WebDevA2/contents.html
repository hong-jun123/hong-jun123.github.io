                <p class="body">
                    Coronary heart disease is the term that describes what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of residue in the coronary arteries from cigarette smoke. 
                    Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath and feeling faint. 
                    Both nicotine and carbon monoxide put a strain on the heart by making it work faster. 
                    They also increase your risk of blood clots. 
                    Other chemicals in cigarette smoke can damage the lining of your coronary arteries, leading to furring of the arteries.
